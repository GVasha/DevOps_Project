- Passwords must always be hashed securely before storage.  
- Use **bcrypt**, **Argon2**, or **PBKDF2** for hashing.  
- Never store or transmit plaintext passwords.  
- Sensitive fields like tokens or API keys must be environment-protected and never hardcoded.

- Do not write spaghetti code. Maintain clean, structured code.
